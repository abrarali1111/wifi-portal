HOW TO DEPLOY (Easiest Method)

1. Go to https://render.com or https://railway.app (Free hosting for Node.js).
2. Connect your GitHub repository.
3. Set the start command to: node server.js
4. Share the provided link.

NEW FEATURES:
- Users now have to REGISTER/LOGIN first.
- Share the link to index.html or just your site URL.
- Users can see their own dashboard.
- You (Admin) can see all Users and Complaints on 'admin.html'.

IMPORTANT:
This version uses a Node.js backend. Drag-and-drop hosting like Netlify or GitHub Pages will NOT work if you need the backend logic (login/data saving) to function.
